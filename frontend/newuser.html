<!-- Since this is a new user, we need to make a call to the database to find the last username is. -->
<!-- So a script should get called here. -->

<!-- The script should create the new username, and create a record with nothing but null values. -->
<!-- It should come back here and then we should go to the first form for the user to fill out. -->
<body>
<h1>Your user name is:</h1>
<!-- whatever name the script finds goes here. -->

<p>Please write this username down for your return visit.</p>
