<!-- Since this is a new user, we need to make a call to the database to find the last username is. -->
<!-- So a script should get called here. -->

<!-- The script should create the new username, and create a record with nothing but null values. -->
<!-- It should come back here and then we should go to the first form for the user to fill out. -->
